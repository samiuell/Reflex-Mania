# Reflex Mania 


## PURPOSE

This program was made in 2022 as the final project for ICS 3UI, in which we were tasked with making a game in python using repl.it. This project served as a way to strengthen skills with tkinter, and hopefully, make something fun along the way. 

## HOW TO PLAY

This project was inspired by the beloved arcade game Guitar Hero. The objective is to "catch" the falling arrows as they overlap their outlines by pressing their corresponding arrow key. Every time you succesfully catch an arrow your score will increase, but every time you fail you will loose a life. The game displays your score, current combo (how many arrows you've caught in a row), and your lives as you play. 

When starting a game, you will first be asked to choose a difficulty. The difficulties decide the initial speed of the arrows, and how fast they accelerate. Regardless of the difficulty, every time you catch an arrow their speed increases by a certain factor, making the game progressively harder the longer you play. If you're looking for motivation- the background changes at certain score amounts. Try to see them all! 

You have six lives to start. Once you loose all your lives, you will be prompted with a randomized trivia question. If you answer the question correctly you will be able to continue your game. If you answer a question wrong, or you have already recieved three trivia questions, it's Game Over. Don't worry though, the Game Over screen will show you your highest score and combo of the game- so you know what to beat for the next time!
